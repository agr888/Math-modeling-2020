# Setting up your computer for Math modeling class

Below you will find summaries for setup of software and **Github** repositories for *Mathematical Modeling of Geological Processes.* 

Code in the class will be written in the [Python](http://www.python.org) programming language. **Python** is a general purpose programming language that can be used to do all kinds of things (write computer games, generate websites, data analysis and visualization, and even for *mathematical modeling!*). There are many packages available for Python that extend its basic functionality. We will need many of these packages for the exercises in this course. To make our lives easier, we will install a specific *distribution* of Python called **Anaconda**.
